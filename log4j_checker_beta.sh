If you see no uncommented output above this line, you are safe. Otherwise check
the listed files and packages.

Some apps bundle the vulnerable library in their own compiled package, so
'java' might not be installed but one such apps could still be vulnerable.

Note: this is not 100% proof you are not vulnerable, but a strong hint!
